# Causality_Correlation_US_Companies
In this repository, I look for the interaction between stock prices of 27 big US companies using correlation and Granger causality matrices. I found that the pair-wise Granger causality interaction between prices in the times of crisis is increasing, and conclude that would be the consequence of simultaneous response of the markets to the outside events or external stimulus that is considered as a common driver to all the stocks, not a result of real causal predictability between the prices themselves. I modelled, the observed patterns in the price of by adding a multiplicative exogenous term as the representative for external factors to the geometric Brownian motion model for stock prices. Altogether, I can detect and model the effects of the Great Recession as a consequence of the mortgage crisis in 2007/2008 as well as the impacts of the Covid out-break in early 2020.
